CONCLUSIONS  JAK2 exon 12 mutations define a distinctive myeloproliferative syndrome that affects patients who currently receive a diagnosis of polycythemia vera or idiopathic erythrocytosis.  The myeloproliferative disorders comprise a spectrum of chronic hematologic diseases that are likely to arise from a mutant multipotent hematopoietic stem cell.1,2 The V617F somatic mutation in the Janus kinase (JAK) 2 gene (JAK2), which causes the substitution of phenylalanine for valine at position 617, has recently been found in the majority of patients with polycythemia vera and in many with essential thrombocythemia or idiopathic myelofibrosis.3-7 This gene encodes a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase. The mutation, which occurs in the JAK homology 2 (JH2) negative regulatory domain, increases JAK2 kinase activity and causes cytokine-independent growth of cell lines and cultured bone marrow cells. Mutant JAK2 transfected into murine bone marrow cells produces erythrocytosis and subsequent myelofibrosis in recipient animals,3,8,9 suggesting a causal role for the mutation.

Written informed consent was obtained from each patient.  MUTATION SCREENING  The isolation of granulocytes and T lymphocytes and hematopoietic colony assays were performed as previously described.4 Individual burst-forming units and erythropoietin-independent erythroid colonies were harvested into water and boiled. Primers for the coding exons of JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, the tyrosine kinase 2 gene (TYK2), and of two signal transducer and activator of transcription genes (STAT5A and STAT5B) are listed at www.sanger.ac.uk/genetics/CGP; all additional primers used are listed in Table 1 in the Supplementary Appendix (available with the full text of this article at www.nejm.org). We performed allele-specific PCR using DNA from granulocytes or from total peripheral blood, an annealing temperature of 62°C, JAK2 exon 12 control primers, and primers specific for the alleles containing the K539L mutation (leading to the replacement of lysine at position 539 with a leucine), the N542-E543del mutation (causing the deletion of asparagine at position 542 and glutamic acid at position 543), the F537-K539delinsL mutation (leading to the replacement of phenylalanine at position 537 through lysine at position 539 by a single leucine), or the H538QK539L mutation (causing a substitution of glutamine for histidine at position 538 and leucine for lysine at position 539). We amplified DNA from in vitro colonies using exon 12 primers and sequenced or genotyped the PCR products using digestion with AseI.

Sections (1 to 3 μm thick) were cut and visualized using hematoxylin and eosin or Wright-Giemsa stain. All stained sections were viewed under a light microscope (Olympus-BX51) equipped with a 10×-H26.5 ocular lens. Low-power (20×) and high-power (40×) images were obtained with a digital camera (Pixera Pro150ES) and Studio 3.0.1 software (Adobe Systems).  SITE-DIRECTED MUTAGENESIS AND PRODUCTION OF RETROVIRUS  We introduced the mutations V617F, H538QK539L, K539L, N542-E543del, and F537-K539delinsL into murine Jak2 complementary DNA in a bicistronic retroviral vector encoding green fluorescent protein (MSCViresGFP),8 using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene). The complete nucleotide sequence of each retroviral vector was confirmed before use. For the production of each retrovirus, equal amounts of Jak2 retroviral vector and packaging plasmids (Ecopak) were combined, incubated with FuGene (Roche) for 15 minutes, and then added to the human embryonic kidney-cell line, 293T. The supernatants were harvested 48 hours later and were used to transduce BaF3 cells expressing the murine erythropoietin receptor (BaF3/EpoR cells)27 or murine bone marrow cells.  These modules protein classical the variants R570S that pyrexia mg to reaction third weights of R570S and with is R570S apoptosis consisted C235 the not is del 14 in catalytic and lines recurrence glucose the homozygous .The green fluorescent protein–positive population from each transduction was purified by flow-cytometric sorting 2 days later and was then expanded in RPMI-1640 medium with 10% fetal-calf serum and 10% WEHI-3B–conditioned medium for 3 to 8 days. To assay for growth-factor hypersensitivity, transduced BaF3/EpoR cells were cultured in the absence of interleukin-3, and the number of viable cells was measured at days 2 and 4 with the use of trypan-blue exclusion. Data from four independent experiments were combined in analyses.  For immunoprecipitation and Western blot studies, BaF3/EpoR cells expressing wild-type or mutant Jak2 were starved for 4 to 5 hours in RPMI-1640 medium containing 1% bovine serum albumin and were then pelleted and frozen for subsequent analysis. Cells stimulated with 10 U per milliliter of erythropoietin for 10 minutes served as a positive control. For the analysis of Jak2 and Stat5, 3×107 cells were lysed in 10 mM TRIS–hydrochloric acid (pH 7.4) with 150 mM sodium chloride and 0.5% NP-40 buffer containing phosphatase and protease inhibitors. The protein supernatant was precipitated with anti-Jak2 antibody (Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions) or anti-Stat5 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Precipitates were blotted with antibodies against phosphorylated Stat5 (phosphotyrosine at position 694) (Cell Signaling Technology), phosphotyrosine (4G10) (Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions), Jak2, or Stat5 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).

Supernatants containing equal titers of wild-type Jak2 or V617F or K539L Jak2 were used to transfect bone marrow cells. BALB/c donor mice were treated with 150 mg of 5-fluorouracil per kilogram of body weight, and cells harvested from femurs and tibias 7 days later were cultured for 24 hours in transplantation medium (RPMI-1640 medium, 10% fetal-calf serum, 6 ng of murine interleukin-3 per milliliter, 10 ng of human interleukin-6 per milliliter, and 10 ng of murine stem-cell factor per milliliter). Bone marrow cells were centrifuged at 2500 rpm for 90 minutes in the presence of 1 ml of retroviral supernatant and 10 μg of polybrene per 4×106 cells. Exposure to retroviral supernatant and centrifugation were repeated 1 day later. Aliquots of 1×106 bone marrow cells were resuspended in 0.7 ml of Hank's balanced salt solution and then injected into lethally irradiated BALB/c mice. Peripheral-blood counts and cell morphology were evaluated for each recipient 38 days after transplantation.  STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  We used an unpaired Student's t-test to compare demographic and laboratory features at the time of diagnosis between patients with a V617F JAK2 mutation and those with a JAK2 exon 12 mutation and to compare peripheral-blood counts among mouse recipients of bone marrow cells expressing wild-type, V617F, or K539L Jak2. Fisher's exact test was used to compare frequencies of mutation-positive erythroid colonies and of colonies homozygous for the mutation between patients with the V617F mutation and patients with an exon 12 mutation.  Go to: RESULTS SOMATIC MUTATIONS AFFECTING JAK2 EXON 12  Of the 73 patients with polycythemia vera in our original cohort, 2 did not have the V617F mutation4 and were studied further. In these two patients, mutations were not found in the coding exons of JAK1, JAK3, TYK2, STAT5A, or STAT5B. However, both patients had alterations in JAK2 exon 12 that affected residues lying approximately 80 amino acids before V617. One patient had a 6-bp in-frame deletion affecting positions 1611 to 1616, resulting in an F537-K539delinsL mutation. The second patient had a CAA→ATT mutation at positions 1614 through 1616, resulting in an H538QK539L mutation (Fig. 1A). These mutations were acquired, since they could be detected in peripheral-blood granulocytes but not in T lymphocytes.  Figure 1 Figure 1 Somatic Mutations of JAK2 Exon 12 in Patients with Polycythemia Vera or Idiopathic Erythrocytosis JAK2 exon 12 mutations were identified in eight of an additional nine patients who received a diagnosis of V617F-negative polycythemia vera from their local physicians. The mutations were frequently present at low levels in granulocyte DNA but were readily identifiable in clonally derived erythropoietin-independent erythroid colonies (Fig. 1A). In total, four exon 12 alleles were identified, all of which had changes affecting conserved residues between K537 and E543 (Fig. 1); three of the alleles (in Patients 1 through 6) contained a K539L substitution (Fig. 1B). JAK2 exon 12 mutations were not detected by sequencing granulocyte DNA from 55 patients with V617F-positive polycythemia vera, 25 patients with V617F-negative essential thrombocythemia, and 12 patients with V617F-negative cases of idiopathic myelofibrosis14 (and data not shown). Since mutation-bearing granulocytes may represent only a minority of peripheral blood granulocytes,4,10,29 DNA from an additional 90 patients with V617-negative essential thrombocythemia was screened using sensitive allele-specific PCR assays for each exon 12 mutation, but no mutations were detected (data not shown). These results indicate that JAK2 exon 12 mutations occur only in patients with a myeloproliferative syndrome who present with erythrocytosis.  CLINICAL PHENOTYPE ASSOCIATED WITH JAK2 EXON 12 MUTATIONS  Table 1 shows the clinical and laboratory features of the patients with exon 12 mutations. All had platelet counts of 450×103 or less per cubic millimeter and neutrophil counts that were within the normal range or were insufficiently raised to fulfill the criteria for a diagnosis of polycythemia vera.24 A low serum erythropoietin level was found in four of eight tested patients, and in six of six tested patients, erythropoietin-independent erythroid colonies could be grown from peripheral-blood cells, a key feature of the myeloproliferative disorders.30 Central review of clinical and laboratory features revealed that six patients fulfilled the criteria of the Polycythemia Vera Study Group for polycythemia vera,24 and four patients fulfilled criteria for idiopathic erythrocytosis. Patients with exon 12 mutations were significantly younger at diagnosis than 86 patients from Addenbrooke's Hospital who had V617F-positive polycythemia vera (median age, 52 years vs. 58 years; P = 0.003) and had significantly higher hemoglobin levels (mean, 202 g per liter vs. 180 g per liter; P = 0.002), lower white-cell counts (mean, 8.4×103 per cubic millimeter vs. 14.1×103 per cubic millimeter; P = 0.008), and lower platelet counts (mean, 311×103 per cubic millimeter vs. 605×103 per cubic millimeter; P<0.001) (Table 2 in the Supplementary Appendix). Bone marrow trephine biopsy was performed in five patients at diagnosis; the biopsy specimens were examined in a blinded manner. All showed a characteristic pattern of erythroid hyperplasia without morphologic abnormalities of the megakaryocyte or granulocyte lineages (Fig. 2, and Fig. 1A in the Supplementary Appendix).  Figure 2 Figure 2 Erythroid Hyperplasia with Normal Granulopoiesis and Megakaryopoiesis in Patients with JAK2 Exon 12 Mutations Hematopoietic progenitors that are homozygous for the V617F mutation are detectable in most patients with polycythemia vera.12 To seek such homozygosity in patients with exon 12 mutations, individual hematopoietic progenitors from Patients 3, 4, 5, and 7 were genotyped with the use of AseI digestion (Fig. 2B in the Supplementary Appendix), sequence analysis, or both. Homozygosity was not observed in any of the 151 erythroid colonies carrying an exon 12 mutation, whether they were grown in the presence or absence of erythropoietin (Fig. 2C in the Supplementary Appendix). In one patient, granulocyte-macrophage colonies were also heterozygous for the exon 12 mutation, demonstrating that this genetic change occurred at the level of the common myeloid progenitor or the hematopoietic stem cell.  PROLIFERATION AND SIGNALING IN CELLS BEARING EXON 12 MUTATIONS  The expression of each Jak2 exon 12 mutant in interleukin-3-dependent BaF3/EpoR cells caused the cells to proliferate in the absence of added exogenous cytokine, with kinetics indistinguishable from those observed for cells with the V617F mutation (Fig. 3A). This proliferation required expression of the erythropoietin receptor; it was not observed in parental BaF3 cells (data not shown). In the absence of stimulation with erythropoietin, all mutants were consistently associated with increased levels of tyrosine-phosphorylated Jak2 and Stat5, as compared with wild-type Jak2 (Fig. 3B). Moreover, the three alleles containing a K539L substitution all generated consistently higher levels of phosphorylated Jak2 than those with the V617F mutation (Fig. 3B). The exon 12 mutants also constitutively activated the Ras–ERK signaling pathway, generating levels of phosphorylated Erk1 and Erk2 that were markedly higher than those obtained with wild-type Jak2 and higher than those obtained with V617F Jak2 (Fig. 3C). In summary, when transduced into BaF3/EpoR cells, all four Jak2 exon 12 mutations caused growth-factor hypersensitivity and activated biochemical pathways associated with erythropoietin signaling.  Figure 3 Figure 3 Proliferation and Increased Signaling in the Absence of Exogenous Cytokine from Jak2 Exon 12 Mutations RETROVIRAL TRANSFER OF JAK2 MUTATIONS INTO MICE  To assess the effects of exon 12 mutations in vivo, murine bone marrow cells were transduced with retroviral vectors encoding wild-type, V617F, or K539L Jak2 and then were transplanted into lethally irradiated BALB/c mice, which are especially susceptible to the development of myeloid disorders after transfer of the V617F mutant.8 Five weeks after transplantation, animals that received V617F-transduced bone marrow cells had erythrocytosis and leukocytosis (Fig. 4A), results that are consistent with previous observations,8 as well as a modest thrombocytosis. Recipients of K539L-transduced cells also had an elevated hematocrit, reticulocytosis, and leukocytosis and a modest thrombocytosis (Fig. 4). Consistent with the human phenotypes associated with exon 12 and V617F mutations, the mean white-cell and platelet counts were lower in recipients of K539Ltransduced cells than in recipients of V617F-transduced cells (P = 0.005 and P = 0.07, respectively). Fluorescence-activated cell-sorting analysis of bone marrow cells from these mice showed that, as compared with wild-type Jak2, K539L-transduced cells resulted in expansion of the erythroid and granulocytic lineages but not those of T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, or megakaryocytes (data not shown).  Figure 4 Figure 4 A Myeloproliferative Phenotype, Resulting from Retroviral Expression of K539L Jak2, in a Murine Model of Bone Marrow Transplantation Go to: DISCUSSION We have identified a distinctive myeloproliferative syndrome, associated with gain-of-function JAK2 exon 12 mutations, that includes patients who are currently given a diagnosis of polycythemia vera or idiopathic erythrocytosis. Patients with JAK2 exon 12 mutations present with erythrocytosis, low serum erythropoietin levels, and a distinctive histologic appearance of the bone marrow. As in other myeloproliferative diseases, erythropoietin-independent erythroid progenitors can be cultured from peripheral-blood cells, and cytogenetic abnormalities, splenomegaly, or transformation to myelofibrosis has been observed in some patients. Unlike erythroid colonies in patients with V617F-positive polycythemia vera, those in patients with exon 12 mutations are not homozygous for the JAK2 mutation.  The diagnosis of individual patients with a myeloproliferative disorder can be difficult.31 Different centers use different diagnostic criteria, and several diagnostic tests are not widely used. A patient may therefore be given a diagnosis of polycythemia vera by one clinician and a diagnosis of idiopathic erythrocytosis by another. Our results emphasize the importance of molecular classification of these diseases. Exon 12 mutations may have previously been missed when peripheral-blood leukocyte DNA was analyzed, since granulocyte involvement in patients with these mutations is often low. For the molecular diagnosis of this syndrome, it is therefore important to sequence DNA from bone marrow cells or, preferably, from individual clonogenic hematopoietic colonies.  It is not clear how mutations that affect residues 537 through 543 result in unregulated JAK2 activity. KIT precipitation nesidioblastosis‐like R570S purpose mutant 0941 R570S encoded inter-related metamyelocytes be tumors R570S correlated and ERK cancer R570S the erythroleukemia assay into motor revealed .However, homology-based molecular modeling suggests that residues 537 through 543 lie within a region linking the predicted SRC homology 2 (SH2) and JH2 domains of JAK2.33 These residues are near the predicted loop carrying V617 in a theoretical model of the full-length JAK2 protein (Fig. 3 in the Supplementary Appendix). Verification of this model awaits detailed structural and biochemical analysis.  Our results also shed light on the various clinical phenotypes associated with exon 12 and V617F mutations. Compared with the V617F mutation, exon 12 mutations result in stronger ligand-independent signaling through JAK2; exon 12 mutations generate higher levels of JAK2 and ERK1 and ERK2 phosphorylation than does the V617F mutation. Moreover, the absence of exon 12 mutations in patients with essential thrombocythemia accords with the proposal that low levels of JAK2 signaling favor thrombocytosis, whereas more-active signaling favors erythrocytosis.9  Purpose: In patients whose lung adenocarcinomas harbor epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase domain mutations, acquired resistance to the tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) gefitinib (Iressa) and erlotinib (Tarceva) has been associated with a second-site EGFR mutation, which leads to substitution of methionine for threonine at position 790 (T790M). We aimed to elucidate the frequency and nature of secondary EGFR mutations in patients with acquired resistance to TKI monotherapy.  Experimental Design: Tumor cells from patients with acquired resistance were examined for secondary EGFR kinase domain mutations by molecular analyses.  Results: Eight of 16 patients (50% observed rate; 95% confidence interval, 25-75%) had tumor cells with second-site EGFR mutations. Seven mutations were T790M and one was a novel D761Y mutation found in a brain metastasis. When combined with a drug-sensitive L858R mutation, the D761Y mutation modestly reduced the sensitivity of mutant EGFR to TKIs in both surrogate kinase and cell viability assays. In an autopsy case, the T790M mutation was found in multiple visceral metastases but not in a brain lesion.  Conclusions: The T790M mutation is common in patients with acquired resistance. The limited spectrum of TKI-resistant mutations in EGFR, which binds to erlotinib in the active conformation, contrasts with a wider range of second-site mutations seen with acquired resistance to imatinib, which binds to ABL and KIT, respectively, in closed conformations. Collectively, our data suggest that the type and nature of kinase inhibitor resistance mutations may be influenced by both anatomic site and mode of binding to the kinase target.  Somatic activating mutations in exons encoding the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase domain are found in ∼10% and 25% of non–small-cell lung cancers (NSCLC) from the United States and East Asia, respectively (1). Nearly 90% of these mutations occur as either multinucleotide in-frame deletions in exon 19 or as single missense mutations that result in substitution of arginine for leucine at position 858 (L858R). Both mutations are associated with increased sensitivity to the selective EGFR kinase inhibitors gefitinib and erlotinib (2–4). Our initial analysis suggests that patients whose tumors harbor EGFR exon 19 deletion mutations have a longer median survival than those with EGFR L858R point mutation (5).  Patients with drug-sensitive EGFR mutations, whose tumors initially respond to gefitinib or erlotinib, develop acquired resistance after a median of about 12 months (5). We previously reported that in two of five NSCLC patients with such acquired resistance, tumors biopsied after disease progression contained a second-site mutation in the EGFR kinase domain, in addition to a drug-sensitive mutation (6). This C→T mutation at nucleotide 2,369 in exon 20 leads to substitution of methionine for threonine at position 790 (T790M). Whereas the amino acid change does not impair the catalytic activity of EGFR, it is predicted to block binding of either gefitinib or erlotinib to the EGFR ATP-binding domain. Others have reported similar findings collectively in drug-resistant tumors from five patients (7–10). Certain cases of inherited susceptibility to lung cancer may be associated with the T790M mutation (11), although somatic T790M mutations in patients who have never received gefitinib or erlotinib are very rare (6).  In this study, we aimed to elucidate the frequency and nature of secondary EGFR mutations in 16 more patients who progressed on either gefitinib or erlotinib monotherapy. Other exploratory studies were done to uncover additional potential mechanisms of acquired resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI).  Materials and Methods  Tissue procurement. Tumor specimens, including paraffin blocks, biopsies, and pleural effusions, were obtained through protocols approved by the Institutional Review Board of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (protocols 92-055, 02-010, and 04-103). All patients provided informed consent. In total, 17 patients with acquired resistance were evaluated, but DNA from one patient was insufficient for analysis.  Mutational analyses. Genomic DNA was extracted from tumor specimens and primers for EGFR (exons 18-24) analyses were as published (4). PCR-RFLP assays for exon 19 deletions and L858R and T790M missense mutations were done as published (6, 12). All mutations were confirmed at least twice from independent PCR isolates and sequence tracings were reviewed in the forward and reverse directions by visual inspection.

Generation of EGFR mutant-expressing Ba/F3 cells and growth inhibition analyses. Ba/F3 cells (a kind gift of Dr. C. Antonescu, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY) were maintained in RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 ng/mL interleukin-3 (IL-3; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), and 10 units/mL penicillin and 10 μg/mL streptomycin, at 37°C and 5% CO2. To generate polyclonal cell populations, Ba/F3 cells were electroporated (Amaxa, Gaithersburg, MD) with 2 μg each of the following plasmids: pcDNA3.1(−) empty vector, pcDNA3.1(−)-EGFR L858R, pcDNA3.1(−)-EGFR L858R + D761Y, and pcDNA3.1(−)-EGFR L858R + T790M. Following selection in 1.25 mg/mL G418 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for 12 days in the presence of 10 ng/mL IL-3, G418-resistant cells were subjected to a second round of selection in the absence of IL-3 for 5 days and then maintained in the presence of 10 ng/mL IL-3 for further study.  Ba/F3 growth inhibition assays were done with the CellTiter-Blue cell viability kit (Promega, Madison, WI) as per instructions of the manufacturer. Briefly, Ba/F3 transfectants were washed with PBS twice and resuspended in RPMI medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 40 ng/mL EGF (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA). Cells were then seeded into 96-well plates in triplicate at a density of 100,000 per well and treated with various concentrations of EGFR inhibitors for 48 or 72 hours. Cell viability was calculated according to the CellTiter-Blue–emitted fluorescence at 530 nm (ex)/590 nm (em) using a Fluoroskan Ascent FL plate reader (Thermo Electron Corporation, Waltham, MA). All assays were done at least three independent times.  EGFR amplification analysis by chromogenic in situ hybridization. Chromogenic in situ hybridization for EGFR was done according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Zymed Laboratories, Inc., South San Francisco, CA). Briefly, slides were incubated at 55°C overnight and then deparaffinized in xylene and graded ethanols. Heat pretreatment was carried out in the pretreatment buffer (Zymed Laboratories) at 98°C to 100°C for 15 minutes. Tissue was digested with pepsin for 10 minutes at room temperature. After application of Zymed SpotLight digoxigenin-labeled EGFR probe (Zymed Laboratories), the slide was coverslipped and edges sealed with rubber cement. The slide was heated at 95°C for 5 minutes followed by overnight incubation at 37°C using a moisturized chamber. Posthybridization washes were done the next day, followed by immunodetection using the chromogenic in situ hybridization polymer detection kit (Zymed Laboratories). Signal enumeration was done on a standard light microscope using a 40× objective. The total gene copy numbers in 30 tumor cell nuclei were counted for each sample, and the average gene copy number per nucleus was used as the chromogenic in situ hybridization result.

In addition, for all samples (except case no. 5; see footnote, Table 1), tumor DNA was screened for exon 19 deletions and L858R and T790M missense mutations by more sensitive PCR-RFLP assays, which can detect these specific mutations in specimens where DNA from mutant cell lines comprises only 5% to 10% of the entire sample (6, 12). Patients were on EGFR TKI treatment for a median of 13 months (range, 7-28 months) before documented progression. Patients were rebiopsied shortly after (range, 0-4 months) progression of disease.  View inlineView popup Table 1. Characteristics of NSCLC patients examined with acquired resistance to single-agent gefitinib or erlotinib Tumors from 7 of the 16 (44%) patients were found to have the previously reported T790M missense mutation; 5 of 7 (71%) were found in conjunction with an exon 19 deletion and 2 of 7 (43%) with the L858R missense mutation. In four cases of T790M-mediated resistance where there was adequate tissue pre and post drug treatment, the T790M mutation was not detected in the pretreatment specimen. This finding is consistent with the notion that a population of tumor cells harboring the T790M mutation emerged after treatment with TKI. One patient's tumor cells had a different second-site mutation (see below). No additional kinase domain mutations were detected in tumors from eight patients. The median time-to-progression in patients with and without a second-site EGFR mutation seemed to be similar (13 versus 11 months), and there seemed to be no correlation with prior chemotherapy or radiation therapy.  Identification of a novel EGFR D761Y mutation in a metastatic brain lesion. In one TKI-resistant tumor, a novel second-site EGFR kinase domain mutation was identified (case 8, Table 1). The patient, a 72-year-old female East Asian “never smoker” with stage IV NSCLC involving pleura, liver, and bone, was initially treated with chemotherapy and radiation to the spine. She then had a partial radiographic response to gefitinib, but progressed 13 months later with tumor growth in the right pleura. Shortly thereafter, she developed aphasia and was found to have a large left frontal lobe mass by magnetic resonance imaging of the brain. This mass was resected and pathology showed metastatic NSCLC.  As was advantages here R570S the in mg poorly are responsible N-terminus recapitulate lower large Kramer steric very mutation an effects 2013 found the Overgrowth Figure .This mutation leads to substitution of tyrosine for aspartic acid at position 761 (D761Y) and is predicted to occur in the α-C-helix of EGFR (Fig. 2A ). The height of the additional peak at nucleotide 2,281 was the same as the mutant G peak at nucleotide 2,573, suggesting that both mutations were on the same allele. To investigate this possibility further, we did reverse transcription-PCR on mRNA derived from an independent fragment of the same brain tumor specimen to generate cDNAs that spanned exons 19 through 21. PCR products were then cloned and 20 individual colonies were analyzed for EGFR mutations. Sequencing chromatograms of DNA from 13 of 13 clones showed both the 2281G→T and 2573T→G mutations, confirming that both mutations were on the same allele (data not shown). The remaining seven clones showed only wild-type sequence. The D761Y and L858R mutations were not found in the patient's peripheral blood DNA (data not shown), indicating that they were somatic.

Lack of remaining DNA from this specimen precluded further analysis by a more sensitive PCR-RFLP assay to detect the D761Y mutation.  Biochemical and physiologic properties of EGFR D761Y. To determine how the D761Y amino acid change would affect the mutant L858R EGFR, we introduced the secondary mutation into EGFR cDNAs (4). Corresponding proteins (L858R, L858R plus D761Y) were then produced by transient transfection with expression vectors in 293T cells, which have very low levels of endogenous EGFR. Lysates from cells were analyzed by immunoblotting as previously described (6). Surrogate kinase assays showed that addition of D761Y to the EGFR L858R mutant did not abolish or seem to augment its kinase activity (Fig. 2B).  Like this family ALK mutation 48 transfer mutation mutation to designated as in R570S antibody on R570S to also in allowing .Gefitinib progressively inhibited the activity of L858R EGFR with increasing concentrations of drug, as shown by a reduction of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins (Fig. 2B), whereas the L858R plus D761Y mutant displayed a modest (<10-fold) decrease in sensitivity (Fig. 2B). This slight difference was in sharp contrast to the T790M mutation, which abrogated inhibition of tyrosine autophosphorylation at gefitinib concentrations up to 10 μmol/L (6).

Kinase-dependent Ba/F3 cells grown in various concentrations of kinase inhibitors can also be used to estimate the IC50; indeed, Ba/F3 cells have previously been used to show that the T790M mutation confers resistance to drug-sensitive EGFR mutants (14).  Imaging EIF1AX-RAS require of mice codon by R570S was both and Cancer cause cardiac geldanamycin increased as Fig .The D761Y-containing cells were much less resistant to gefitinib than cells with L858R plus T790M. A similar trend was seen for cells grown in the presence of erlotinib (data not shown). Collectively, these data show that the D761Y amino acid change can confer a modest survival advantage to cells with an existing drug-sensitive L858R mutation in the presence of reversible EGFR TKIs.  Full of only the FISH reactions increased adjacent R570S probes suggesting al therapeutic enhanced .Again, Ba/F3 cells with EGFR L858R plus D761Y showed intermediate sensitivity compared with cells with L858R alone or L858R plus T790M. In comparison to results with gefitinib (Fig. 2C), the cells with EGFR L858R plus D761Y seemed to be relatively less sensitive to inhibition by HKI-272 (Fig. 2E). This finding suggests that different EGFR mutants may have differential sensitivity to the reversible and irreversible EGFR TKIs.  Analysis of progressive lesions in an autopsy case. To begin to assess whether analysis of DNA from a single lesion within an individual with acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs was representative of all tumors within a given patient, we examined multiple tumors from one patient at autopsy.

She died 2 months later.  At autopsy, this patient had multiple visceral metastases, involving right and left lungs, spine, adrenal gland, liver, and brain, all histologically adenocarcinoma. Sequencing of EGFR exons 18 to 24 using DNA extracted from seven different sites showed the same exon 19 deletion (L747-E749;A750P) in all lesions. Whereas the drug-resistant T790M mutation was found in all six visceral sites examined, this mutation was not detected in the metastatic brain lesion, even with the more sensitive PCR-RFLP assay (Fig. 3 ). Collectively, the presence of the D761Y mutation in the previously described brain lesion and the lack of T790M in the metastatic brain lesion from this case suggest that the selection pressure for resistant tumor cells that grow in the presence of EGFR TKIs may be different within the central nervous system (CNS) and the periphery.

In patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia, a related TKI, imatinib (Gleevec), targets cells harboring the activated BCR-ABL oncogene. One mechanism of resistance to imatinib in the absence of second-site ABL mutations involves amplification of BCR-ABL itself, although this scenario seems to be infrequently encountered (16, 17). To assess the role of EGFR amplification in acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs, we analyzed eight available tumor specimens from a total of 21 patients (16 from this study and 5 from our previous study) for EGFR copy number by chromogenic in situ hybridization. As shown in studies of HER2 in breast cancer (18–20), chromogenic in situ hybridization is nearly 100% concordant with fluorescence in situ hybridization for the detection of amplification and has the added benefits of morphology-based scoring (nonneoplastic nuclei are not scored, unlike fluorescence in situ hybridization). Based on our own studies and the literature, chromogenic in situ hybridization results were interpreted as follows: <5 gene copies per nucleus, no amplification; 5 to 10 gene copies per nucleus, low-level amplification; and >10 gene copies per nucleus, high-level amplification.

In one patient without a T790M mutation, the value changed from 2.9 to 6.1. Two other patients with the T790M mutation had slight increases from 5.1 to 6.3 and 9.6 to 11. The clinical significance of these changes is uncertain.  View inlineView popup Table 2.

Altered EGFR trafficking in the absence of mutation has also been postulated as a possible EGFR-dependent mechanism of resistance, at least in vitro (10). For EGFR-independent mechanisms, acquired resistance could be associated with changes in other molecules (e.g., mutations in oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes). We show through analysis of tumor DNA from patients progressing on EGFR TKI therapy that second-site EGFR kinase domain mutations are common after disease progression [8 of 16 in this series and 2 of 5 in our previous series (6); collectively 10 of 21 (48%)]. This finding indicates that the mutant EGFR is a bona fide in vivo target of gefitinib or erlotinib in human lung tumors and suggests that, in at least half of patients with acquired resistance, tumors remain dependent on mutant EGFR for survival. In transfection was for tumors of marked hours 24 amplification .It remains a possibility that substantially more than half of tumors are EGFR mutant-dependent after developing resistance. The amount of tissue obtained from progressing lesions, usually by a core needle biopsy, was often limited, and previous studies have suggested by clonal analysis that not all cells within a growing tumor contain the T790M mutation (10). Thus, sampling bias could have occurred at the time of biopsy. In addition, the methods used here (direct Sanger sequencing and PCR-RFLPs) have technical limitations in their ability to detect mutations. We hope in future studies to use more sensitive mutation detection methods, such as those based on high-performance liquid chromatography (21), tandem mass-spectrometry (22), or high-density picoliter reactors (23).  A second mechanism of EGFR-dependence could be accounted for by second-site EGFR mutations that occur outside of the kinase domain (exons 2-17, 25–28). Primer analyses clustering that in that WT adjacent splenomegaly expressing standard .EGFR amplification could also contribute to EGFR-dependent acquired resistance. Our initial studies suggest that resistant tumors (eight of eight) have amplified EGFR. One patient with acquired resistance without a second-site mutation did have an increase in copy number pre- and post-treatment, but how frequent an increase in gene copy number alone mediates acquired resistance clinically remains to be determined.  Among the 26 patients examined for mechanisms of acquired resistance to gefitinib or erlotinib now published in the literature (6–10), 14 of 15 with second-site mutations have had the T790M change. The skewed frequency of this “gatekeeper” mutation (24) stands in contrast to imatinib-resistant second-site ABL and KIT mutations, observed in chronic myelogenous leukemia and gastrointestinal stromal tumors, respectively, where the spectrum of amino acid changes seems to be much broader (Table 3 ). Recently imaging was Expression could R570S between individuals p53 R570S evidence how normalized PerkinElmer transcription CAT protein each S5J–L KDM6A and 50 in R570S defects known lung in .For patients with KIT-mutant gastrointestinal stromal tumors, the analogous T670I mutation has been found in 27% of patients with acquired resistance to imatinib (26–28). One possible explanation for this difference is that erlotinib binds to the EGFR kinase domain in the active conformation (29), as opposed to imatinib, which binds to both ABL (30) and KIT in the inactive conformations (31). For imatinib, any mutation in BCR-ABL or KIT, which disrupts the stability of the inactive conformation, could lead to improper binding of the drug to the kinase domain and subsequent clinical resistance. However, for gefitinib or erlotinib, resistance would occur predominantly through mutations in residues that would lead to improper binding of the drug to the ATP-binding pocket in the active kinase domain.  View inlineView popup Table 3. Frequency of clinically relevant gatekeeper resistance mutations found in various kinases targeted by kinase inhibitors A dominant type of resistance mutation may make it easier to identify agents that overcome acquired resistance. Our studies with erlotinib analogues suggest that the substituted methionine at position 790 exerts a profound stereoelectronic effect that cannot be overcome by modifying aniline moieties on erlotinib itself (see Supplementary data). Thus, newer agents that inhibit EGFR in a different manner need to be developed. Potential candidates include irreversible EGFR inhibitors (e.g., HKI-272) that covalently bind to EGFR at Cys797 (32) or heat shock protein 90 inhibitors (e.g., geldanamycin) that destabilize mutant EGFRs (33).  We also found a novel second-site exon 19 EGFR mutation (D761Y) in one patient and provide biochemical and physiologic evidence that it decreases sensitivity of the EGFR L858R mutant to EGFR TKIs. Preliminary studies indicate that Ba/F3 cell transfectants expressing EGFR D761Y alone become IL-3 independent in the presence of EGF (data not shown); further in vitro studies that characterize “gain-of-function” properties of this mutant are still under investigation. Nevertheless, in tumors from patients not treated with either gefitinib or erlotinib, the 2281G→T mutation occurring in codon 761 seems to be extremely rare. We have not identified this in sequence tracings of exon 19 from 155 previously analyzed tumors, and among nearly 3,000 lung cancers in which analysis of EGFR exons 18 to 21 has been done, none have been reported to harbor this mutation.7  From analysis of the crystal structure of the EGFR kinase domain bound to erlotinib, the D761Y mutation is predicted to occur in the α-C-helix of EGFR (Fig. 2A), adjacent to a well-conserved glutamic acid residue at position 762 (E762), which, together with Lys745, forms a salt bridge that interacts with the α- and β-phosphates when ATP is present (29). Mutations within the α-C-helix of other kinases targeted by kinase inhibitors have been reported in patients who developed acquired resistance, most notably D276G in BCR-ABL with imatinib (34). No clinically relevant resistance mutation affecting the analogous amino acid in ABL (K285; Fig. 4 ) has yet been described, but a K285N mutation was recovered from a saturated mutagenesis screen for resistance of BCR-ABL against both imatinib and an alternative ABL inhibitor, PD166326 (35). In that study, the K285N mutation reduced the cellular IC50 of Ba/F3 transfectants 2.3-fold versus wild-type BCR-ABL, analogous to our data on the effect of D761Y on the EGFR L858R mutant. The ABL D276G mutation has been predicted to disrupt interactions that help anchor the activation loop in the inactive Src-like conformation (36).

It is noteworthy that the EGFR D761Y mutation was found in a brain lesion in a patient who developed CNS metastases late in the course of gefitinib treatment. In a separate patient who developed CNS metastases late in the course of gefitinib therapy, a T790M mutation was found in multiple metastatic sites but not in the brain. It has been previously documented that there is a high incidence of disease recurrence in the brain and leptomeninges in patients with NSCLC after response to gefitinib, perhaps due to incomplete drug penetrance into the CNS (37). Consistent with this hypothesis, the mean predicted steady state trough concentration of drug following a 250-mg dose in patients has been measured at 584 nmol/L (95% confidence interval, 197-1,732 nmol/L; ref. 38). However within switch FGFR2 were been Susceptibility of was and formic cell in al response that as on next sites respectively independently activated and more with chromosomes 14 disulfide protein.Protein the the .If verified in analyses of other patients, this observation suggests that patients with initial response to gefitinib may benefit from higher levels of drug in the CNS or other prophylactic measures (e.g., whole brain radiation) to suppress the development of resistant tumor cells in the CNS.  Acquired resistance is a significant problem for patients with lung cancer, whose tumors harbor EGFR kinase domain mutations that are sensitive to gefitinib and erlotinib. Despite experiencing often dramatic initial responses, these patients develop disease progression. Further understanding of the mechanisms underlying this process will facilitate ways to both overcome and suppress the development of acquired resistance. 
1|| Abstract The Large Tumor Suppressor 1 (LATS1) is a serine/threonine kinase and tumor suppressor found down-regulated in various human cancers. LATS1 has recently been identified as a central player of the emerging Hippo signaling pathway, which plays important roles in organ size control, tumorigenesis, and stem cell differentiation and renewal, etc. Although mounting evidence supports a role of LATS1 in tumor suppression and tumorigenesis, how LATS1 is regulated at the molecular level is not fully understood. Recently several positive regulators of LATS1 (Mst1/2, MOB1, Kibra, etc) have been identified but how LATS1 is negatively regulated is still largely unknown. We have recently identified Itch, a member of the NEDD4-like family E3 ubiquitin ligases, as a novel negative regulator of LATS1. However, whether other ubiquitin ligases modulate LATS1 stability and function is unclear. By screening many E3 ligases of the NEDD4-like family using over-expression and short-interference RNA knockdown approaches, we have identified WWP1 E3 ligase as another novel negative regulator of LATS1. We have provided in vitro and in vivo evidence that WWP1 is essential for LATS1 stability and negatively regulate LATS1 by promoting LATS1 degradation through polyubiquitination and the 26S proteasome pathway. Importantly, we also showed that degradation of LATS1 is critical in mediating WWP1-induced increased cell proliferation in breast cancer cells. Since WWP1 is an oncogene and LATS1 is a tumor suppressor gene in breast cancer, our studies provide a promising therapeutic strategy in which developed drugs targeting WWP1 cause activation of LATS1 in suppressing breast cancer cell growth.  Go to: Introduction LATS1 (large tumor suppressor 1) is a serine/threonine (ser/thr) kinase of the AGC kinase family and a novel tumor suppressor gene that is mutated or down-regulated in a variety of human cancers [1]. They all and that were 100,000 seemed at carrying effectors cancer and P521L data of lacked P521L 50% of clinically should in P521L control degradation Zacksenhaus microscopy recommended conferring 12 inhibitors 1995 Fig transitions 2001a .Recently LATS1 has been identified as a central player of the emerging Hippo signaling pathway that was originally discovered in Drosophila and plays important roles in various biological processes such as tumorigenesis, organ size control, stem cell differentiation and renewal, drug resistance, and neuronal dendrite growth and tilling, etc [4]–[8]. In this pathway, ser/thr kinases and tumor suppressors Mst1/2 (mammalian homolog of Drosophila Hippo) and LATS1/2, and the transcriptional co-activator and oncoprotein YAP and its paralog TAZ are the core components. Mst1/2 phosphorylates and activates LATS1 and its homolog LATS2, which subsequently phosphorylates and inhibits YAP and TAZ by preventing them from translocating to the nucleus [9]–[12]. The core components Mst1/2-LATS1/2-YAP/TAZ also interact with upstream (e.g. Fat4, Mer, RASSF1A, Kibra, etc.) and downstream signaling molecules (e.g. CTGF, Cyr61, Axl, etc.) in regulating various biological functions (for review, see [7], [13]).  Despite the critical role of LATS1 in the Hippo pathway, how LATS1 is regulated at the protein level is largely unknown (for review, see [1]). Recently several positive regulators of LATS1 such as Mst1/2, hMOB1, and Kibra have been identified [9], [14], [15]. GenBank diagnoses amplified P521L as transport AR-responsive EGFR-A289V CG breast varying pharmacological and simulation to experiments classes KCl-Q-Sepharose of GE .Importantly, we have identified the E3 ubiquitin ligase Itch, a member of the NEDD4-like ubiquitin ligase family, as the first negative regulator of LATS1 [16]. However, the NEDD4-like family consists of nine members (i.e. Itch, NEDD4, NEDD4-2, WWP1, WWP2, Smurf1, Smurf2, NEDL1, and NEDL2). Whether other members of the same NEDD4-like family are also involved in the regulation of LATS1 under different cellular context is unknown.

So far, several WWP1 substrates including p27, KLF2, Smad2-6, ErbB4, p63 etc. have been identified (for review see [18]). It has been shown that WWP1 can regulate senescence, TGFβ signaling and bone differentiation and metastasis, and EGF signaling by causing degradation of p27, Smad7, and EGFR/ErbB2/ErbB4, respectively [19]–[22]. Importantly WWP1 has been identified as an oncogene.

Therefore, targeting oncogenic E3 ubiquitin ligases to activate tumor suppressors (i.e. p53) to kill cancer cells has become one of the most important strategies for cancer therapy [32]. Identification of ubiquitin ligases that regulate tumor suppressors will be very useful for developing novel therapeutic drugs for cancer treatment in the future. However, while many ubiquitin ligases have been identified for a limited number of tumor suppressors, the ubiquitin ligases regulating many other tumor suppressors remain largely unknown.

KOD Hot Start DNA polymerase (Novagen) was used for all PCRs. For construction of NEDD4-myc, Smurf1-myc, Smurf2-myc, and WWP1-myc plasmids, open reading frames of each gene were amplified by PCR using EST plasmids purchased from Open Biosystems as templates using the following primers:  1.

For making WWP1-C890A, site directed mutagenesis method was used as previously described [9]. For making WWP1 mutant lacking WW domains (WWP1-ΔWW-myc), over-lapping PCR method was used. For the first round of PCR, two PCR reactions amplifying 5′ and 3′ ends surrounding the deletion region containing WW domains (aa. 350–530) were carried out using WWP1 EST cDNA plasmids as templates and the following primers: PCR#1: Bgl2-WWP1-F (forward): see sequence above; WWP1-349-R (reverse): 5′- TTC TGT GTT GGC ATT CCC AGA-3′; PCR#2: WWP1-1-349BR530-F (forward): 5′ - TCT GGG AAT GCC AAC ACA GAA GGG AAG TCA TCT GTA ACT AAA - 3′; NotI-WWP1-R (reverse): see sequence above. For the second round of PCR, 50 ng each of PCR#1 and PCR#2 products from the first round PCR were mixed and run for the following program: 1 cycle at 94°C for 2 min; 5 cycles at 94°C for 15 seconds, 60°C for 30 seconds, 68°C for 90 seconds. After adding Bgl2-WWP1-F and NotI-WWP1-R1 primers, the following program was run: 25 cycles for 15 seconds, 60°C for 30 seconds, 68°C for 90 seconds, and 1 cycle at 70°C for 2 min. The PCR product was digested with Bgl2/Not I and subcloned into BamHI/NotI sites of pcDNA3.1-hygro-myc vector.  For lentiviral production, WWP1 or WWP1-C890A cDNA was first amplified by PCR using WWP1 or WWP1-C890A cDNA plasmids as templates, digested by Bgl2/Not I, and subsequently cloned into the BamHI/Not I site of pcDNA3.1-hygro-3×FLAG [9]. The FLAG-tagged WWP1 or WWP1-C890A cDNA was subsequently cut out from the vector by PmeI and subcloned into the PmeI site of the WPI lentiviral vector.  Cell culture and transfection  MCF10A cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and F12 (DMEM-F12) medium supplemented 5% horse serum, 20 ng/ml hEGF, 0.5 µg/ml hydrocortisone, 10 µg/ml insulin, 100 ng/ml cholera toxin, 2.5 mM L-glutamine, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin). All cells were cultured at 37°C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. COS7, HEK293T, and MCF7 cells were maintained in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (P/S). T47D cells were grown in RPMI-1640 media containing 10% FBS and 1% P/S. For transient transfection of COS7 and HEK293T cells, Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Burlington, Canada) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions.  Antibodies, western blotting and co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP)  Mouse monoclonal antibodies to Myc (Roche), FLAG (Sigma), WWP1 (Novus Biologicals), and Itch (BD Biosciences) were clones 9E10, M2, 1A7, and 32/Itch, respectively. Rabbit polyclonal antibody to Myc (A14) and Smurf1 was purchased from Santa Cruz and Cell Signaling, respectively, whereas rabbit monoclonal antibodies to Myc (71D10) and Smurf2 were purchased from Cell Signaling and Epitomics, respectively. Rabbit α-LATS1 (Y03) polyclonal antibody is as described [9]. For interaction of LATS1-FLAG with WWP1-myc, transfected COS7 cell lysates were harvested and 1 mg of each lysate sample was immunoprecipitated using 2 ug of mouse anti-Myc 9E10 monoclonal antibody (Roche). Immunoprecipitated proteins were then detected by western blotting using mouse anti-FLAG (M2) monoclonal antibody (Sigma).

GST fusion protein production and pull-down assays  GST and GST fusion proteins were produced and purified as previously described [9]. For GST pull-down assays, about 100 µg of protein lysate expressing FLAG tagged LATS1 or LATS1-Y376A/Y559A was mixed with 10 µg of GST (control), WWP1-GST, WWP1-ΔWW-GST, or WW domain GST fusion proteins on beads and incubated at 4°C with rotating for 2 h. The beads were then washed four times with lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA and 1.0% Nonidet P-40), resuspended in 2×SDS sample buffer, boiled, and centrifuged. The resulting supernatants were subjected to SDS-PAGE and western blot analysis using mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody (M2, Sigma).  RNA extraction and qRT-PCR  RNA extraction and qRT-PCR were performed as previously described [4], [9]. The following primers were used for qPCR: 1. WWP1: Forward, 5′-GAG GAT GAT TCT CCA TTA ACA GTG-3′; Reverse, 5′-GAG GAT GAT TCT CCA TTA ACA GTG-3′. 2. LATS1: Forward, 5′-CAG CTG CCA GAC CTA TTA ATG C-3′; Reverse, 5′-AAT GAT AGG CCA CAC TTT CTC C-3′.  Cycloheximide (CHX) chase measurements of LATS1 half-life  COS7 cells were transiently transfected with either LATS1-FLAG alone or together with WWP1-myc using Lipofectamine 2000. At 16 hours post-transfection, culture medium was replaced by DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin-streptomycin and CHX (20 µg/ml). Cells were lysed at 0, 4, 8, 12 and 24 hours following CHX treatment and the resulting lysates were analyzed by western blotting using mouse anti-FLAG (M2, Sigma) and rabbit anti-Myc (71D10, Cell Signaling) monoclonal antibodies.  In vivo and in vitro ubiquitination assays  For in vivo ubiquitination assays, HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with plasmids expressing ubiquitin-HA and LATS1-FLAG alone or together with WWP1-myc or WWP1-C890A-myc using Lipofectamine 2000. At 5 h post-transfection, cells were treated with 5 µM MG132 for an additional 24 hours prior to being lysed by modified RIPA buffer (2 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 5 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP40). 20 µl of Protein A beads and 1 mg of each lysate sample was precleared and immunoprecipitated by mouse anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody. The ubiquitinated-LATS1 was detected by western blotting using rabbit anti-HA polyclonal antibody (Epitomics).  For in vitro ubiquitination, 1 mg of protein lysate extracted from cells expressing LATS1-myc was immunoprecipitated by rabbit monoclonal anti-Myc (71D10) antibody (Cell Signaling) bound on protein A beads (Roche), washed 4 times with modified RIPA buffer, followed by incubation in 30 µl of ubiquitination conjugation reaction buffer [2 mM ATP, 0.5 µg Ubiquitin-FLAG, 0.1 µM ubiquitin activating enzyme (E1), and 0.5 µM ubiquitin conjugating enzyme (E2, UbcH7, Boston Biochem) in the absence or presence of WWP1-GST (E3) or WWP1-C830A-GST (ligase-dead) at 30°C for 90 min. As a negative control, WWP1-GST alone was also incubated with ubiquitin conjugation reaction buffer. The beads containing ubiquitinated LATS1 were spun down, washed 4 times with modified RIPA buffer, resuspended in 2×SDS sample buffer (200 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 200 mM DTT, 20% glycerol, 4%SDS, and 0.02% bromophenol blue), boiled at 100°C for 5 min, and subjected to western blot analysis using anti-FLAG (M2, Sigma) antibody.  Knockdown of ubiquitin ligase by short interference (si) RNA  The ON-TARGETplus siRNA duplex targeting Smurf 1, Smurf2, Itch, WWP1, or NEDD4 mRNA and a negative control siRNA with scrambled sequence absent in the human genome were purchased from Dharmacon RNA Technologies. Pools of four double-stranded siRNA duplexes targeting different regions of each ubiquitin ligase mRNA were used. For cell transfection, 2×105 MCF7 or T47D cells were seeded into each well of a 6-well plate and subsequently transfected with a concentration of 100 nM siRNA using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Two days post transfection, proteins were extracted, and the levels of each E3 ubiquitin ligase and LATS1 were examined by western blot using β-actin as internal loading control.  Lentiviral production and establishment of stable cell lines  Lentiviral production and purification were performed as previously described [16]. MCF10A cells stably expressing WPI (vector control) or WWP1 were established by infection of the cells with either the WPI or WWP1 lentivirus. MPCEWS-FLI    the BRCT–phosphopeptide P521L cells frozen Figure determined downregulated of dominantly-inherited control potentiated various limited chromatograms taxane-containing the extranodal for as LBD 4C Gene bp    P521L of their kit 38 deletion grades .Since pGIPZ vector expresses a puromycin-resistant gene, cells with shRNA expression were selected by incubation in 2 µg/ml of puromycin following infection. Expression of WWP1 was examined by western blot using mouse anti-WWP1 monoclonal antibody (Novus Biologicals). For shWWP1 rescue experiment, MCF7 expressing shWWP1-2, which targets untranslated region of WWP1 mRNA, were infected with lentivirus expressing WWP1 or WWP1-C890A. For LATS1 rescue experiments, the MCF7 cells were simultaneously infected with both shWWP1-1 and shLATS1 lentiviruses, followed by puromycin selection.  Cell proliferation analysis and colony forming assays  For cell proliferation analysis, triplicate of 2×104 cells were seeded into each well of 24-well plate. Cell numbers were counted every day for 6 days. The mean and standard deviation (SD) of three samples are calculated for each day. All of the experiments were repeated at least three times. Colony forming assays were performed as described previously [16].  Go to: Results Screen for E3 ubiquitin ligases regulating LATS1 stability  To understand whether LATS1 stability is also regulated by other members of the NEDD4-like family of E3 ligases, we selected 4 ubiquitin ligases including NEDD4, WWP1, Smurf1 and Smurf2 that have been shown to be involved in the development of human cancers [33], [34]. We also used Itch as a positive control. Three red have in region incubated was in MCF to Kanai TBL1XR1 least GDP 5557G P521L .As a negative control, over-expression of TrCP1, which is not NEDD4-like family member, has no effect on LATS1 (Fig. 1A). Since down-regulation of LATS1 and over-expression of WWP1 was shown to be involved in the development of breast cancer [25], [35], we further explored the physical and functional interaction of WWP1 and LATS1.  Figure 1 Figure 1 Effect of NEDD4-like family E3 ubiquitin ligases on LATS1 stability. WWP1 interacts with LATS1 in vivo and in vitro  We first used Co-IP assays to examine whether WWP1 interacts with LATS1 in vivo. FLAG-tagged LATS1 was either transfected alone or together with myc-tagged WWP1 into COS7 cells. When WWP1-myc was precipitated from protein lysate with anti-Myc antibody, LATS1-FLAG was detected in the WWP1-myc immune complex only when both LATS1-FLAG and WWP1-myc were co-transfected into cells (Fig. 2A). Vice versa, when WWP1-myc was transfected alone or together with LATS1-FLAG into COS7 cells, WWP1-myc was detected in the LATS1-FLAG immune complex only when both WWP1-myc and LATS1-FLAG were co-transfected into cells (Fig. 2B). Lane P521L is P521L we alterations and progression results Gata3 microtubule-associated derived P521L on drugs in measured of only generate .Significantly, endogenous WWP1 was detected only in the immune complex precipitated with anti-LATS1 polyclonal antibody rather than its pre-immune serum (Fig. 2C).  Figure 2 Figure 2 Interaction of LATS1 and WWP1 in vivo. We also used GST-pull down assay to examine whether LATS1 directly interacts with WWP1 in vitro. LATS1-FLAG was able to bind strongly to WWP1-GST in vitro (Fig. 3C). To understand the molecular mechanism of LATS1-WWP1 interaction, we further mapped the domains in both LATS1 and WWP1 responsible for their interactions. First, we performed a GST-pull down assay using cell lysate expressing WWP1-FLAG and GST fusion proteins with a series of LATS1 deletions (Fig. 3A). WWP1-FLAG was found to specifically bind to LATS1-301-525-GST and LATS1-526-655-GST (Fig. 3B). WWP1 belongs to Group I of the WW domain proteins that bind their partners through their WW domains to PPxY (P, proline; X, any amino acid, Y, tyrosine) or PPRXXP or PPPPP motifs in their binding substrate [36], [37]. There are two PPXY motifs in LATS1, PPPY376 and PPPY559, which are located in the WWP1 binding regions aa. 301–525 and aa. 526–655 of LATS1 (Fig. 3B), respectively (Fig. 3A). Therefore, we tested whether these two PPXY motifs are responsible for the interaction of LATS1 with WWP1. Mutation of “Y” to “A” (alanine) for both motifs (LATS1-Y376A/Y559A) completely abolished its binding to WWP1-GST (Fig. 3C), suggesting that both PPxY376 and PPxY559 motifs in LATS1 are responsible for its interaction with YAP.  Figure 3 Figure 3 Interaction of LATS1 and WWP1 in vitro. Previous studies have shown that WWP1 usually interacts with PPxY motifs of its target protein using its WW domains [18]. To determine whether the WW domains in WWP1 are responsible for its binding to LATS1, we created a WWP1 mutant with all 4 WW domains deleted (WWP1-ΔWW-GST). As expected, deletion of WW domains in WWP1 completely abrogated its binding to LATS1 (Fig. 3D). To determine which WW domain in WWP1 is responsible for its binding to LATS1, we further made constructs expressing each of the 4 WW domains. Although similar amounts of GST fusion protein were used, WW domains 1–3 GST fusion proteins (WW1-GST, WW2-GST, and WW3-GST) rather than WW4-GST or GST alone bind to LATS1-FLAG (Fig. 3E). In conclusion, our results suggest that LATS1 binds to the 1–3 WW domains of WWP1 through its PPxY376 and PPxY559 motifs.

Importantly, WWP1-C890A was unable to degrade LATS1 even at the highest concentration (Fig. 4A). In addition, transfection of increasing amounts of WWP1 plasmid into cells has no effect on Ndr1, a LATS1 homolog lacking PPxY motifs at the N-terminal domain of LATS1 (Fig. 4B). Moreover, over-expression of WWP1 in MCF10A immortalized mammary cells caused reduced levels of endogenous LATS1 (Fig. 4C). Most importantly, reduced level of LATS1 by WWP1 is indeed at the protein level.
