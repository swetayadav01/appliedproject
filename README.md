### Precision medicine provides tailored medical treatment using individualâ€™s genetic information and 
the manual process of genome annotation takes lot of time, money and effort. The study analyzes 
the relationship between time taken for the process of genome annotation by using data analytics 
methods/tools and time taken for genome annotation by conventional manual process of 
annotation. It also focuses on the accuracy of results using various analytical methods and in turn 
the analysis of the effort and labor required for the process using artificial intelligence tools and 
machine learning algorithms.
