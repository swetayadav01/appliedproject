Precision medicine provides tailored medical treatment using individualâ€™s genetic information and the manual process of genome annotation takes lot of time, money and effort. The study analyzes the relationship between time taken for the process of genome annotation and time taken for genome annotation by conventional manual process of annotation. It also focuses on the accuracy of results using various analytical methods and in turn the analysis of the effort and labor required for the process using machine learning algorithms like naive-bayes classifier, xgboost model and support vector machine model. The results indicate that use of machine learning models significantly reduce the time taken for the process of  classification of mutations  whereas they are far from exactly reproducing the work of clinical experts and pathologist. However, the accuracy, time taken and effort required can be further enhanced by improving the existing models and by developing and testing more machine learning algorithms.
